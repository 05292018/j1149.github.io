ListReceivedByAddress
========================

*Requires wallet support.*

The `listreceivedbyaddress` RPC lists the total number of pai's received by each address.

*Parameter #1---the minimum number of confirmations a transaction must have to be counted*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "Confirmations"
  t: "number (int)"
  p: "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d: "The minimum number of confirmations an externally-generated transaction must have before it is counted towards the balance. Transactions generated by this node are counted immediately. Typically, externally-generated transactions are payments to this wallet and transactions generated by this node are payments to other wallets. Use 0 to count unconfirmed transactions. Default is 1"

{% enditemplate %}

*Parameter #2---whether to include empty accounts*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "Include Empty"
  t: "bool"
  p: "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d: "Set to `true` to display accounts which have never received a payment.  Set to `false` (the default) to only include accounts which have received a payment.  Any account which has received a payment will be displayed even if its current balance is `0`"

{% enditemplate %}

*Parameter #3---whether to include watch-only addresses in results*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "Include Empty"
  t: "bool"
  p: "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d: "Set to `true` to display accounts which have never received a payment.  Set to `false` (the default) to only include accounts which have received a payment.  Any account which has received a payment will be displayed even if its current balance is `0`"

{% enditemplate %}


*Result---addresses, account names, balances, and minimum confirmations*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "`result`"
  t: "array"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "An array containing objects each describing a particular address"

- n: "→<br>Address"
  t: "object"
  p: "Optional<br>(0 or more)"
  d: "An object describing an address"

- n: "→ →<br>`involvesWatchonly`"
  t: "bool"
  p: "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d: "Set to `true` if this address is a watch-only address which has received a spendable payment (that is, a payment with at least the specified number of confirmations and which is not an immature coinbase).  Otherwise not returned"

- n: "→ →<br>`address`"
  t: "string (base58)"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "The address being described encoded in base58check"

- n: "→ →<br>`account`"
  t: "string"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "*Deprecated: will be removed in a later version of Pai Core*<br><br>The account the address belongs to.  May be the default account, an empty string (\"\")"

- n: "→ →<br>`amount`"
  t: "number (pai's)"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "The total amount the address has received in pai's"

- n: "→ →<br>`confirmations`"
  t: "number (int)"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "The number of confirmations of the latest transaction to the address.  May be `0` for unconfirmed"

- n: "→ →<br>`label`"
  t: "string"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "The account the address belongs to.  May be the default account, an empty string (\"\")"    

- n: "→ →<br>`txids`"
  t: "array"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "An array of TXIDs belonging to transactions that pay the address"

- n: "→ → →<br>TXID"
  t: "string"
  p: "Optional<br>(0 or more)"
  d: "The TXID of a transaction paying the address, encoded as hex in RPC byte order"

*Example from Pai Core 0.13.1*

List addresses with balances confirmed by at least six blocks, including
watch-only addresses:

```
pai-cli -testnet listreceivedbyaddress 6 false true
```

Result (edit to show only two entries):

```
[
    {
        "address" : "mnUbTmdAFD5EAg3348Ejmonub7JcWtrMck",
        "account" : "test1",
