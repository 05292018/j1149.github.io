# Thank You!

We are so happy that you are interested in contributing to this site, community, and the world in general.

Anyone can comment, add vote emojis, or silently lurk on any issue in the J1149 Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/issues).

### If you would like to create or resolve an issue, this is the (current) process:

- Identify something that you want to improve or suggest an improvement regardless of your coding ability. If it is not tracked in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/issues), add it!
- If you are ready to tackle an item in the issue tracker, we recommend that you discuss the initiative before making an attempt. For large issues: we recommend that you describe your plan in the issue ticket or via the [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/j1149-pai/shared_invite/enQtNTQ3MzE3OTkxMDEzLWIxNTkzODkwYTdmNjI1YmIxMzExZTk4MjIxNWEwZGVhYjJkMGU5OTc1ZDhmNmM2MjkxNGFjZjVkYThjYTBmODM).
- You can send issue-solving code via slack, email, postcard, or carrier pigeon. For the technically inclined, we recommend [submitting changes as a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

Your changes will go live if people generally agree that your improvement is good. Even better, it might be eligible for a [bounty](/bounty)! Merged pull request contributors will be added to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/graphs/contributors) and thanked for being very cool.
